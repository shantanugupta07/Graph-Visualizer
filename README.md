## Features
- Visualize graph traversal algorithms: Dijkstra, A*, and BFS.
- Randomly generate nodes and edges to create a graph.
- Highlight the shortest path found by the algorithms.
- User-friendly controls to generate new graphs and start visualization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shantanugupta07/Graph-Visualizer
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd graph-visualizer
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Use the controls at the top to generate a new graph.
3. Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
4. Click on the "Start" button to visualize the algorithm.

## Algorithms
### Dijkstra
- **Time Complexity**: O(V^2)
- **Description**: Finds the shortest path from the start node to the end node in a weighted graph.

### A*
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Description**: An extension of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses heuristics to improve performance.

### BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Description**: Explores all the nodes at the present depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

## Contributing
